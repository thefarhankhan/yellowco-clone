 # Yellowco.co Business Website - Cloned Version
I have attempted to make a cloned version of good-looking Website only with HTML and CSS. The website I chose is Yellowco which was originally made from Squarespace. I cloned it minimizing the CSS as much as i could using only two files:
1-index.html
2-styles.css

Below is the link to the original website: 
https://yellowco.co/

Here is the cloned version:
